## 1 Introduction 

### 1.1 Motivation

Most of us have experienced waiting at the airport for the delayed flight. As the holiday season approaches, departure on-time have becoming more and more challenging. This year, there are already [more than 4,000 flights delayed](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/27/1139327883/flights-delayed-canceled-holiday-travel-thanksgiving) as holiday travel spikes in the U.S. The flight delay issue especially concerns busy metropolitan airports like JFK.

Using JFK departed flights as an example, we’re interested in exploring the factors that are potentially related with flight delay (e.g., airlines, weather, and COVID conditions). By doing so, we'd like to give the holiday travelers a better sense of what to expect regarding flight delay for this holiday season, in order to make better travel plans accordingly.

### 1.2 Related Work

#### Common Reasons for Flight Delays

Commercial aviation is a complex distributed transportation system. The typical operation of a commercial flight can take place at terminal boundaries, airports, runways, and airspace, being susceptible to different kinds of delays. Some examples include mechanical problems, weather conditions, ground delays, air traffic control, runway queues and capacity constraints.

#### Typical Operation of a Commercial Flight

The following scheme is repeated several times throughout the day for each flight in the system:

```

Source: [Sternberg, et al. (2017). A Review on Flight Delay Prediction.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315382748_A_Review_on_Flight_Delay_Prediction)

Pilots, flight attendants and aircrafts may have different schedules due to legal rests, duties, and maintenance plans for airplanes. So, any disruption in the system can impact the subsequent flights of the same airline. Moreover, disturbances may cause congestion at airspace or other airports, creating queues and delaying some flights from other carriers. 

&nbsp;

### 1.3 Initial Questions

Considering the availability and scale of the flight data, we focus on JFK Airport's delay and cancellation data from Nov. 1st, 2020 to Jan 31st, 2021. And then find the weather and covid cases data within that time range accordingly. Based on these information, our final questions are below:

* What are the key trends of the flights in JFK during last holiday season?
* What are the potential factors that contribute to the flight delay in JFK during last holiday season?
* Are there significant associations of multiple factors with JFK flight delays during last holiday season?

### 2.3 Data Cleaning

**Weather Condition**

First, we imported the NOAA weather data. To align the time unit of weather with flight information, also considering data availability, we picked the weather at the 51th minute to represent the weather condition of the hour, and the weather at 23:59 to represent the weather condition of the day.

```{r, eval = F}
noaa = read_csv("data/weather.csv", na = c("","NA"))

## 3 Explore

### 3.1 Desination Airport

There are 66 and 65 destination airports in the delay and cancellation datasets, respectively. For the efficiency purpose in statistical analysis, we do not include destination airport as a predictor in our models, but we still kept it as one of the predictor to explore.  
First, we checked if delay and cancellation counts differ in different destination airports. Flights from JFK to LAX have the highest delay occurrences with a number of 2293 and flights to BGR have the highest delay occurrences with a number of 6. Flights from JFK to SFO have the highest cancellation occurrences with a number of 76 and flights to BZN have the highest cancellation occurrences with a number of 1. We also took a look at whether different airlines could have different trends in delay and cancellation counts among all the destination airports, but there is no significant findings.  
We found that LAX and SFO have outstanding delay and cancellation counts, so we decided to take a closer look at the underlying factors behind those delays and cancellations. Some interesting findings are: 

*   The airlines which departure from JFK to the two airports are different. 
*   Both airports show an increasing trend in delay minutes from November to January. 
*   There is a distinct difference in cancellation counts in each scheduled hour between the two airports.


&nbsp;

### 3.2 Cancellation and Delay

We then created a **Shiny App** for the audience to engage in our data exploration process. The audience could select which airline and which month they concern and get the user-selected outputs. In the **Cancellation** tab, they could observe the number of cancellations and the number of COVID cases in each day of a month. In the **Delay** tab, they could observe the number of delays and the average delay time in minutes in each day of a month.


&nbsp;


### 3.3 Categorical Predictors

**Delay time** in minutes is one of our outcome of interests and we decided to conduct a **linear regression model**. Besides the main effects, we would like to check if there are any significant effect modifiers in our model. In this part, we investigated the interaction between the categorical predictors, including Periods of Time， Months，and Airlines.  
We could clearly observe that between groups differences are existed, and adding interaction terms between the categorical predictors could be one of the options for building the linear regression model.

&nbsp;

### 3.4 Continuous Predictors

We were also interested in whether our continuous predictors, including Carrier Delay, Extreme Weather Delay, Late Arrival Delay, NAS Delay, Security Delay, Temperature, Humidity, Visibility, Wind Speed, could have different effects on different levels of periods of time, months, or airlines. Based on the graphs, we found that there could be significant interactions between:

*    Carrier Delay * Airline

*    Temperature * Month

As a result, these interaction terms in addition to other predictors would be further analyze using statistical testing, such as cross validation, ANOVA, Type III analysis.ition to other predictors.
