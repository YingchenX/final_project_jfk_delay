## Overview 

We're a group of graduate students at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 

The mutual interest about travel and the shared experience of waiting for delayed flights in JFK united us together to do this project. 

Our technical skill sets of coding in R would thank to [P8105 Data Science I](https://p8105.com/index.html) taught by Prof. Jeff Goldsmith in fall 2022.
