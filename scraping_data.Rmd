First, write a scraping function.

```{r}
scrape_rating = function(url){

  air_html = read_html(url)
  
  air_rest_vec = 
    air_html %>% 
    html_nodes(css = ".company-link") %>% 
    html_text()

  air_rest_rate_vec = 
    air_html %>% 
    html_nodes(css = ".ratings") %>% 
    html_text()
  
  air_df = 
    tibble(
      rest_name = air_rest_vec,
      rating = air_rest_rate_vec
    ) %>% 
    mutate(
      rating = as.numeric(str_extract(rating, "\\d+\\.*\\d*"))
    )
    
  air_df
  
}
```
