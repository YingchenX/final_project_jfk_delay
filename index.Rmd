## Website Overview

Where are you heading to during the holiday season? 

As the holiday season approaches, the demand for departure flights from NYC is booming. However, trip planning is always accompanied by the issue of potential flight delay, especially in busy metropolitan airports like JFK. Using JFK departed flights as an example, we’re interested in exploring the factors that are potentially related with flight delay or cancellation (e.g., airlines, weather, and COVID conditions), in order to give the holiday travelers a better sense of what to expect regarding flight schedules for this holiday season. 

Our analysis focuses on the flight delay data from [the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/), with the most popular airlines’ data in the manually selected time ranges of last holiday season (11/1/2021 - 1/31/2022). Meanwhile, the weather condition information was obtained from [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd), and COVID information from [the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3).

## Key Questions We Care About

<br>

**1. What are the key trends of the flights at JFK during last holiday season?**

  * Which flight route from JFK, or which carrier had a record of delay or cancellation? 
      *  Let's map it!
  * How does the pattern of delay or cancellation look like? Are there any similarities with those pattern of COVID cases? 
      *  Piles of plots generated here - for each carrier, in each day of the months!
  
  
**2. What are the potential factors that contribute to the flight delay or cancellation in JFK during last holiday season?**

  *  Could categorical variables and continuous variables affect flight delay time? 
      *  Before we put them in any model, let's do some interaction check first!
      
  *  Could categorical variables and continuous variables affect cancellation? 
      *  Before we put them in any model, let's do some stratified analysis first!


**3. Are there significant associations of multiple factors with JFK flight delays and cancellations during last holiday season?**

  *  Let's do some regression analysis! 
      *  Linear regression for delays (continuous) 
      *  Poisson regression for cancellations (count)


**4. How to bear my time in JFK waiting for the flight?**

  *  A guidance to spend your time in JFK to wait for the delayed flights, and we also generated a bunch of pictures via AI as well (just for fun)!
