## Tentative Project Title

Reviews on JFK Flight Delay Conditions During Winter Vacation Season


## Motivation for This Project

As the holiday season approaches, the demand for departure flights from NYC is booming. However, trip planning is always accompanied by the issue of potential flight delay, especially in busy metropolitan airports like JFK. Using JFK departed flights as an example, we’re interested in exploring the factors that are potentially related with flight delay (e.g., carrier, weather, and COVID conditions), in order to give the holiday travelers a better sense of what to expect regarding flight delay for this holiday season. 


## Intended Final Products

*   A report summarizing the analysis of the JFK delay datasets
*   A web page including analyses and visualizations
*   A screencast showcasing the user journey of the website
*   A Github repo recording all the collaboration processes


## Anticipated Data Sources

*   [Flight delay and cancellation data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/) - The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) 
*   [Weather condition data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd) - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
*   [COVID data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3) - NYC OpenData


## Planned Analyses 

*   [Contributing factors] Figure out contributing factors to flight delay by heatmap 
*   [Regression analysis] Test for the association between contributing factors and flight delay using regression analysis, also test for the difference in various rating criteria among the different levels of factors using stratified analysis (ANOVA)
*   [Predictive analysis] Build a model to predict the estimated flight delay time of JFK in the upcoming holiday season, given carrier, weather, and COVID conditions.


## Visualizations and EDA

*   Trends: Descriptive table or histogram showing criteria’s distribution by categories or by time
*   Map: Interactive map showing the analyzed flight routes departed from JFK


## Coding Challenges

*   Scraping airport basic information from airport official websites
*   Data cleaning, data wrangling
*   Visualization
*   Writing functions, conducting hypothesis testing
*   Building models to calculate grading for each airport, creating Shiny App (as applicable)
